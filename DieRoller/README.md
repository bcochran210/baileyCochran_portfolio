# DieRoller
# Project Summary

The following application, upon running, rolls 5 die each with a different amount of faces. The different faces consist of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100. After each die is rolled, the application will also display the number the die actually landed. 

# Running the Program

The program requires an understanding of the Command Prompt if on Windows, Terminal if on Mac, and Java 8.0 or higher installed on the target system.

To launch the program, the user most access their Command Prompt or Terminal, depending on the user's preferred OS. Then, the use needs to navigate to `Drive:\Project Folder Location\DieRoller\dist`. Once there, type in the command `java -jar "TicTacToe.jar"`. Once the command has been typed in, the program will automatically roll the 5 die, and display their outputs. 

The output is displayed as: d# (number of faces on the die) = # (face the die landed on).

# Classes Documentation

The project consists of two major classes. A main class that choses the the die face, and calls upon the die class to create new dies, and roll each one, and sends that value back to the main class, which then displays the value to the user.
